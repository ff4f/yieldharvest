## Automated Security Checks

### Static Analysis Tools
```bash
# Run Slither for static analysis
npx slither contracts/

# Run MythX for security analysis
npx mythx analyze contracts/

# Run Solhint for code quality
npx solhint contracts/**/*.sol
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:security

# Run gas optimization tests
npm run test:gas

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify contract deployment
npm run verify:contracts

# Check contract state
npm run check:state

# Validate configuration
npm run validate:config
```
